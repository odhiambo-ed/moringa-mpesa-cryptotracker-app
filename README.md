## Description

> The app is a cryptocurrency data dashboard that fetches and displays information about cryptocurrencies from the CoinGecko API. It provides data such as the name, symbol, current price, and market cap of the top cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it retrieves global cryptocurrency market data, including total market cap, 24-hour volume, and Bitcoin dominance. The app is built using webpack and deployed on GitHub Pages for easy access.
